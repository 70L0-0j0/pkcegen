# pkcegen
 PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) Generator for OAuth2 Authentication This repository contains a flexible and customizable Python class for generating PKCE parameters required for OAuth2 authentication flows. It supports both S256 and plain code challenge methods and provides configurable options for generating code verifiers, code challenges, states, and nonces, ensuring compatibility with the PKCE standard.  Features: PKCE Compliance: Generate code verifiers between 43 and 128 characters, ensuring compliance with OAuth2 PKCE standards. Customizable Code Challenge Method: Supports both S256 (SHA-256 hashing) and plain challenge methods. Random State & Nonce Generation: Securely generate state and nonce parameters for your OAuth2 requests. URL-Encoded Payload: Easily generate the complete OAuth2 request payload with all required parameters. This implementation is ideal for developers looking to integrate secure PKCE-based OAuth2 flows into their applications, ensuring robust and flexible authentication.
